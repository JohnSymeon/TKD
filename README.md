# TKD-1.1

The current C program in CMD notifies the user if a student from a selected class is absent for a set amount of consecuative sessions or more.

The user may add students to the database which is a simple text file. Then, they can use the the option of checking absences by typing the ID of the present students. If a student is absent for a set amount of sessions or more, after saving the current present students, the user is properly notified. If a bad input is detected, the program exits without saving. A class should not be selected more than once for a given session, since it is risking adding more absences than there cureently are.

The need for such software arised from making it easier for combat sports teachers to keep track of when a student has not attended a session for consecuent times.

The current supported language is English and Greek (written in greeklish).
