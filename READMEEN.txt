consequative days. You navigate the program by typing and then pressing Enter.

Generally speaking, bad inputs automatically terminate the program but there
is a small chance they may cause unpredictable behaviour and should be avoided.

WARNING: When selecting attendances keep in mind that every time you select a
class, you update the file as if it is a new session if you have  previously
saved properly.

You may terminate and rerun the program to do different classes.

You may change the contents of students.txt but it is of utmost importance they
follow the program's format: CLASS LASTNAME FIRSTNAME CONS.ABSENCES.
